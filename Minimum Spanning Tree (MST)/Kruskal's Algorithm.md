A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a tree that spans all the vertices in a connected, undirected graph while minimizing the total edge weight. 
There can be multiple MSTs for a given graph, but they all have the same total weight. MSTs have applications in network design, transportation systems, and other areas where the goal is to connect nodes while minimizing cost.
